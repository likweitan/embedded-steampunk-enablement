# Exercise 1 â€“ Build an extension on S/4HANA Cloud 
## Introduction
This Hands-On workshop will guide you to build developer extensions in a S/4HANA Cloud ABAP Environment system (S4HC). You will use released BAdls to implement custom code and enhance an existing business application. You will also create your own transactional UI and use released RAP facades to enhance existing functionality. 
We will focus on the development tasks. Deployment of UIs and UI development in general will be only partly touched. 
In this tutorial, wherever XXX appears, use the number assigned to you (e.g. JB1 if your name is James Bond; in case JB1 is taken, please use JB2 instead).
